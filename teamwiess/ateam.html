  <h3 style="text-align:center;">In the beginning....</h3>
  <p>In the beginning there was a man with a dream. Harry Carothers Wiess, famed oil tycoon and founder of Humble Oil (aka Exxon, Exxon-Mobil) who left Rice a big chunk of cash upon his death in 1948 for the building of Wiess Hall, the fourth residential hall on campus.</p>
  <p>
  In 1949, Wiess opened for business. In its modest beginnings, Wiess had only 100 rooms and a small Commons. At Wiess, architecture truly is destiny as the unique “Motel 6″ design with outdoor hallways and wrap-around balconies brought instant notoriety for its rowdy social atmosphere. The additions of wings to the original design split the college into two sections, each with their own courtyard and personality: the Acabowl, where the action was, and the Backabowl, where a quieter atmosphere prevailed for sunbathing or studying. Some insist that “Old Wiess,” as it’s become known, was supposed to be temporary housing after the GI bill of WWII caused an influx in enrollment. Like most Rice myths, this one sounds good enough to believe but contains no actual truth. Old Wiess was built to last, and it did, through 2002. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

          <p>Welcome to Team Family Wiess from the Schaefer Family! Although this is the Schaefers’ first year as Masters of Wiess, they have a long history with the college. Andrew is Wiess ‘94 (CAAM and Math Econ) and Laura is Wiess ‘95 (MECH and English), and they met as undergrads at (Old) Wiess in 1991. They started dating two years later, when Laura built a (still-extant) exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum and Andrew had a summer job doing math for the CIA (shhh!) in Washington, DC. They went off to graduate school at Georgia Tech in 1995, where they received their PhDs, and were professors at the University of Pittsburgh from 2000-2015. (During that time, the Schaefer family spent a magical year on sabbatical in London, where they lived in a small, fifth-floor flat in the middle of everything.)</p>
          <p>Andrew is a professor in the Department of Computational and Applied Math. His research is in optimization, in particular how to make decisions in treating diseases. Laura is a professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department. Her work is centered on improving the environmental impact of energy consumption, both through increasing energy efficiency and investigating alternative energy generation technologies. Andrew grew up in Williamsburg, Virginia, and Laura lived in Illinois, Houston (well, the Woodlands), and Maryland. They love international travel, HBO series, foreign films, art, literature, hiking and all kinds of music.</p>
          <p>There are two other important members of the Schaefer family: Elizabeth (nearly 13, and a self-proclaimed member of the Wiess class of 2026) and David (10). Elizabeth is a rising seventh grader at St. John’s School. She enjoys all of her subjects. She runs track, plays field hockey, and does junior classical league and quiz bowl (her team won the Texas state championship for her grade level last year). She has been interested in economics for many years. David is a rising fourth grader at Annunciation Orthodox School (obviously a Greek school, though we aren’t Greek). He is very adept at Legos and origami, and will happily challenge you to a game of chess. He is really into Greek mythology, and loves Percy Jackson. He likes camping, playing guitar, throwing Frisbees, and eating xiao long bao. Both are voracious readers who also love playing outside with their friends. The kids have been to over 40 countries – they love learning about various cultures, including food, history, and a few phrases.</p>
          <p>The Schaefers are die-hard sports fans – Rice, of course, and an eclectic collection of professional teams: White Sox, Pirates, Packers, Steelers, Bulls, and Penguins. Andrew's grandfather played high school football for Curly Lambeau in Green Bay! They were a divided family during Super Bowl XLV between the Packers and Steelers.</p>
          <p>The Schaefers are eager to welcome you to Wiess, and to the residential college system, which is part of what makes Rice the best undergraduate institution. The college system is both a small, intimate setting where you get to know a group of students extremely well, and also a framework for students to develop different cultures. The college system includes everyone, while maintaining eleven separate identities. The Schaefers feel that the Rice college system (and Wiess in particular) is "in their DNA" - it has shaped them (and continues to shape them) in many ways. As Masters, they are eager to help you in your journey through the undergraduate years - please share both your concerns and your triumphs with them, and join them for a chat about Rice, Houston, or your future path.</p>

                    <p>Renata is not known for making many mistakes, but once upon a time she was an Associate at a lesser college. She was quick to fix that lapse in judgment and dragged Lenin to join TFW. This will be their 5th year as RAs! Gavin (also known as the Acatoddler) and Evan (known as the Acababy) have been Wiessmen all of their lives: they were born across the street, but only took them 36 hours to find their way to Wiess. These four from the 3rd floor love to spend time around Wiess and Wiessmen, and their door is always open if you need to chat, relax or simply have somebody listen to you.</p> 
                    <p>Besides being RAs at the best college, Renata teaches in the Bioengineering department, Lenin works for Schlumberger, Gavin loves to play in the Acabowl and Evan goes wherever everyone else goes since he cannot move on his own. They enjoy food and travel and can be found regularly cheering for your Battlesows on the powderpuff field. Lenin likes scuba diving and Renata likes horseback riding; so Lenin dials back his respect for horses to go riding and Renata chooses to forget the reasons why humans are not aquatic to go diving.  Gavin absolutely loves baseball, frisbee, balls and the trampoline and he can be spotted playing in the Acabowl most days (he’ll drag you to play if you let him). Evan is always eating or sleeping, but will most likely be running around by the time you graduate. Join them for dinner, a movie, Monday Night Football or barbacoa study break!</p>

        <p>Emilie ("Emmie") is the 4th floor RA. She is a scientist (Materials Science) educated at Northwestern and Cambridge University. She is fascinated by understanding the world around her by shooting lasers and electrons at it, and also has wide-ranging interests and an always positive personality. Amongst her hobbies, she spends several days a month traveling, lots of it for work; she enjoys every moment of it. She also loves when people travel to see her, and several times a year she hosts her brother AJ or her partner John; both get involved with college life by co-organizing study breaks….talking of which, watch out for Emmie’s famous pancake study breaks, as well as liquid nitrogen ice cream shows!</p>
        <p>Emmie is a seasoned runner, and has completed 6 marathons so far. She is eager to share her love of running and healthy living with Fellow Wiessmen. Look for her weekly running schedule in your email inbox, and come join her for a moderately-paced 3 to 6 miles run around campus! She also loves speaking her native French, going to the symphony, and studying alongside Wiessmen.</p>
