  <h3 style="text-align:center;">In the beginning....</h3>
  <p>In the beginning there was a man with a dream. Harry Carothers Wiess, famed oil tycoon and founder of Humble Oil (aka Exxon, Exxon-Mobil) who left Rice a big chunk of cash upon his death in 1948 for the building of Wiess Hall, the fourth residential hall on campus.</p>
  <p>
  In 1949, Wiess opened for business. In its modest beginnings, Wiess had only 100 rooms and a small Commons. At Wiess, architecture truly is destiny as the unique “Motel 6″ design with outdoor hallways and wrap-around balconies brought instant notoriety for its rowdy social atmosphere. The additions of wings to the original design split the college into two sections, each with their own courtyard and personality: the Acabowl, where the action was, and the Backabowl, where a quieter atmosphere prevailed for sunbathing or studying. Some insist that “Old Wiess,” as it’s become known, was supposed to be temporary housing after the GI bill of WWII caused an influx in enrollment. Like most Rice myths, this one sounds good enough to believe but contains no actual truth. Old Wiess was built to last, and it did, through 2002. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
